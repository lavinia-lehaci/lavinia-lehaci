# Hi, I'm Lavinia!

## About me
My name is Lavinia Lehaci, and I am a recent game development enthusiast. 

I started my software development journey as a student at VIA University College where I got my Bachelor's Degree in Information & Communication Technology (which was rebranded as Software Engineering right after I graduated). During my studies, I had an internship in Barcelona, and then worked as a student worker at The LEGO Group. After graduating, I moved to Vienna, where I worked as a Java Engineer for 2 years before starting my Master's program in Computer Science at University of Vienna. 

During my Master's, I developed a strong interest in C++ and game development. My thesis focused on creating a [C++ library](https://github.com/lavinia-lehaci/ViennaGameAILibrary) for game AI algorithms, aimed at real-time strategy game development, including pathfinding, decision trees, and steering behaviors. I graduated in January and am currently looking for roles in Game Development or C#/C++ development. In the meantime, Iâ€™ve been working on personal projects, such as a [Procedural Terrain Generator](https://github.com/lavinia-lehaci/Procedural-Terrain-Generator) that I developed using Unity and C#.

ðŸ‘¾ Facts about me
- I enjoy playing games from various genres, including Valorant, Marvel Rivals, Brawlhalla, Baldur's Gate, Hogwarts Legacy, It Takes Two, Minecraft, and Sims.
- I also enjoy reading â€” though I tend to devour a book in a day and then not touch another one for months.
